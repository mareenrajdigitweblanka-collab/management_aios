# Validation Check — Remove Leave Approval Workflow and Simplify Leave Lifecycle

**Check date:** 2026-07-16

## Requirement

User decision: remove the approval/status workflow (Pending/Approved/Rejected/Cancelled, Approve/Reject/Cancel actions, status-based history, status-based normal-calendar filtering) from the Management AIOS calendar leave-copy feature entirely, across backend, database, schemas, API, tests, reporting, conflict logic, and frontend. New rule: every saved leave record is immediately active (appears in calendar, blocks conflicting tasks, contributes leave-deduction minutes) until soft-deleted via a single Delete Leave action (`deleted_at`). No replacement active/inactive/status enum. Preserve leave types, leave-system time periods, and the Short Leave 120-minute cap rules (only the cap-membership condition changes, from status='Approved' to deleted_at IS NULL).

## Old Lifecycle

`Pending → Approved | Rejected | Cancelled`, with `Approved → Cancelled` as the only post-approval transition. Rejected/Cancelled were terminal and excluded from the normal calendar (visible only in a separate history view). Only `status='Approved'` rows consumed the Short Leave cap, contributed to reporting, or blocked task conflicts.

## New Lifecycle

`Create → Active → Delete (soft)`. Every row with `deleted_at IS NULL` is active — visible in the calendar, cap-consuming (Short Leave), reporting-contributing, and conflict-blocking. `DELETE /api/member-leave/{member_key}/{leave_id}` is the only removal mechanism (soft delete). No history view; no status field anywhere in the schema, API, or UI.

## Schema Changes

- New migration `database/migrations/2026-07-16-remove-member-leave-status-workflow.sql`: soft-deletes existing Rejected/Cancelled rows (`COALESCE(deleted_at, now())` — only touches rows where `deleted_at IS NULL`, so an already-deleted row's original timestamp is preserved), drops the `status` column and its CHECK constraint, drops the two status-keyed indexes (`idx_member_leave_records_member_status`, `idx_member_leave_records_approved_conflict`), adds two `deleted_at`-keyed replacement indexes (`idx_member_leave_records_short_leave_active`, `idx_member_leave_records_active_conflict`). Wrapped in `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`, idempotent (`IF EXISTS`/`IF NOT EXISTS` guards throughout).
- `database/member_leave_records_schema.sql` (fresh-install target) updated to the no-status shape, matching the migration's end state.
- `backend/models.py`: `MemberLeaveRecord.status` column and its CHECK constraint removed. `deleted_at` and `coordination_copy_only` preserved unchanged.
- No new lifecycle/status/active-inactive enum column was introduced anywhere — confirmed by inspecting the final model and schema files.

## Migration Mapping

| Original status | Migration result |
|---|---|
| Pending | Active row (no `deleted_at` change) |
| Approved | Active row (no `deleted_at` change) |
| Rejected | Soft-deleted (`deleted_at` populated) |
| Cancelled | Soft-deleted (`deleted_at` populated) |

Confirmed as a documented, one-way business decision (not a lossless transform) in both the migration file's own comments and the design document §0/§16 rollback notes — a soft-deleted row's original Pending/Approved distinction is not reconstructable from `deleted_at` alone.

## API Changes

**Routes remaining (confirmed via `app.openapi()` — see Tests section):**

```
GET    /api/member-leave/{member_key}
POST   /api/member-leave/{member_key}
PUT    /api/member-leave/{member_key}/{leave_id}
DELETE /api/member-leave/{member_key}/{leave_id}
GET    /api/member-leave/{member_key}/summary
```

**Routes removed:** `GET /api/member-leave/{member_key}/history`, `POST /api/member-leave/{member_key}/{leave_id}/cancel` — confirmed absent from the OpenAPI schema.

**Schema field changes (confirmed via `MemberLeaveRecordOut`/`Create`/`Update`/`LeaveSummaryOut`/`LeaveConflictItemOut` `model_fields` inspection — see Tests section):**
- `status` removed from `MemberLeaveRecordOut`, `MemberLeaveRecordUpdate`, `LeaveConflictItemOut`.
- `LeaveSummaryOut.short_leave_approved_minutes` renamed `short_leave_active_minutes`.
- `DailyScheduleReportOut`/`WeeklyScheduleReportOut`/`MonthlyScheduleReportOut.approved_leave_minutes` renamed `active_leave_minutes` (all three report schemas).

**Behavior changes:** `POST` now computes and snapshots `effective_leave_minutes` and runs the Short Leave cap check immediately at creation (previously deferred until a separate approval step that no longer exists). `PUT` no longer accepts or validates a status transition; recalculates `effective_leave_minutes` and re-checks the cap whenever a date/time field changes. `DELETE` soft-deletes and returns `{"id": ..., "deleted": true}`, matching the existing `member_schedules` delete convention (404 on repeat, via `_get_active_record_or_404`).

## Frontend Changes

`web-view/index.html`:
- `LEAVE_STATUS_CLASS` map removed; leave chips/blocks (`.msc-cal-chip-leave`, `.msc-tg-allday-chip-leave`, `.msc-tg-leave-block`) now use one fixed `--draft` visual treatment instead of a per-status color variant.
- Show History button, history panel, `loadLeaveHistory`, `renderLeaveHistoryList`, and all associated state (`leaveHistoryItems`, `leaveHistoryVisible`, `leaveHistoryWrapEl`, `leaveHistoryListEl`, `leaveHistoryToggleBtn`) removed.
- `allowedLeaveTransitions`/`applyLeaveStatusChange` replaced with a single `deleteLeaveRecord(leaveId, btn)` function — confirms via `window.confirm`, calls `DELETE`, then refreshes the calendar, the leave list, and the leave-deduction report.
- `renderLeaveList` no longer renders a status badge or Approve/Reject/Cancel buttons; renders one "Delete Leave" button per leave item instead.
- The leave-conflict error-message builder no longer reads `c.status` (removed from the 409 body).
- The Schedule Summary panel's leave-deduction row reads `report.active_leave_minutes` (was `report.approved_leave_minutes`) and is labeled "Leave deduction" (was "Approved leave (deduction minutes)").
- Leave-coordination notice text no longer references "status" as a stand-in for HR approval identity.
- Confirmed via grep: zero occurrences of `lv.status`, `LEAVE_STATUS_CLASS`, `leave-pending`/`leave-approved`/`leave-rejected`/`leave-cancelled`, `data-leave-action`, `/history`, or `/cancel` remain anywhere in the file.

## Cap Behavior

`compute_short_leave_approved_minutes_for_month` renamed `compute_short_leave_active_minutes_for_month`; filter changed from `status == 'Approved'` to `deleted_at IS NULL` (leave_type='Short Leave' filter unchanged). `assert_short_leave_monthly_cap_not_exceeded` renamed `assert_active_short_leave_monthly_cap_not_exceeded`; same `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` row-locking transaction strategy preserved, now invoked at both creation and edit (previously only at the former approval step). Confirmed no `status` reference remains in `leave_logic.py` via grep (only explanatory comments confirming the removal).

## Conflict Behavior

`find_conflicting_approved_leave` renamed `find_conflicting_active_leave`; filter changed from `status == 'Approved'` to `deleted_at IS NULL`. Both call sites in `backend/routers/member_schedules.py` (`create_member_schedule_event`, `update_member_schedule_event`) updated. `leave_conflict_response_body` no longer includes a `status` key in each conflict entry — confirmed by the updated `ConflictResponseBodyTests.test_response_body_shape_and_no_purpose_field` test, which now explicitly asserts `assertNotIn("status", conflict)`.

## Reporting Behavior

`approved_leave_minutes_for_date`/`compute_approved_leave_minutes_for_period` renamed `active_leave_minutes_for_date`/`compute_active_leave_minutes_for_period`; the underlying interval-merge/overlap-deduplication/daily-cap-540 algorithm is byte-for-byte unchanged — confirmed by running the existing `OverlapDeduplicationTests` suite (9 tests, renamed calls only, same assertions/expected values) with zero failures. `_leave_report_additions` in `member_schedules.py` renamed its local variable and returned dict key from `approved_leave_minutes` to `active_leave_minutes`, matching the renamed schema field.

## Deletion Behavior

`DELETE /api/member-leave/{member_key}/{leave_id}` added to `backend/routers/member_leave.py`, using the same `_get_active_record_or_404` pre-check used by `GET`/`PUT` (so a soft-deleted or nonexistent id returns 404 on repeat delete, matching `member_schedules`'s existing single-delete convention exactly — no idempotent-200-on-repeat behavior was introduced, since that repo convention does not use one).

## Tests

- `backend/tests/test_member_leave.py` updated: `StatusTransitionTests` replaced with `SimplifiedLifecycleTests` (asserts `status` absent from `MemberLeaveRecordOut`/`Create`/`Update` via Pydantic `model_fields`); `FakeLeaveRecord.status` field removed; all `approved_leave_minutes_for_date` calls renamed `active_leave_minutes_for_date`; `ConflictResponseBodyTests` updated to assert no `status` key.
- **62/62 tests pass** in `backend.tests.test_member_leave` (`python -m unittest backend.tests.test_member_leave -v`).
- **132/132 tests pass** across the full backend suite (`python -m unittest discover -s backend/tests -p "test_*.py"`) — confirms zero regression in unrelated schedule-classification and duration-reporting test suites.
- `python -c "from backend.main import app"` succeeds (no import errors from the renamed/removed symbols).
- `app.openapi()` inspected directly: confirmed exact route set (`GET`/`POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE`/`GET .../summary`, no `/history`, no `/cancel`) and confirmed `status` absent from every leave-related schema's `properties`.

## Live Validation

**Database:** connected successfully to the live Neon database (`management_aios` schema confirmed present, `member_leave_records` table confirmed present, 3 existing rows: 2 Approved + 1 Cancelled, 0 already-deleted). The user ran `database/migrations/2026-07-16-remove-member-leave-status-workflow.sql` manually. The assistant reconnected afterward and independently verified: `status` column absent, `status` CHECK constraint absent, 2 active rows, 1 soft-deleted row (matches the expected mapping exactly), the three intended indexes present and the two dropped status-keyed indexes absent, and `member_schedule_events` unchanged at 195 rows. See `evidence/database/member-leave-status-removal-migration-execution-2026-07-16.md` for the full pre- and post-migration record. **Database migration: PASS.**

**API/frontend live smoke test (Steps 19–20):** **not performed in this pass.** The production API (`management-aios-api.vercel.app`) was still running the pre-amendment code as of the migration check (deployment follows this validation pass). A follow-up live-validation pass (create → appears in GET → blocks task → affects reporting → delete → disappears → no status field anywhere) is required once the code is deployed — see the final report/handover for deployment confirmation status.

## Known Limitations

- The Rejected/Cancelled → soft-deleted migration mapping is a one-way, explicit business decision (see design doc §17) — not reversible to the original per-row status without a separately reviewed migration, and even then only for whichever rows a reviewer manually reclassifies.
- Live end-to-end API/frontend validation (Steps 19–20) is deferred to a follow-up pass, pending the user running the migration and this code being deployed (see above).
- `backend/routers/leave_logic.py`'s DB-dependent functions (`compute_short_leave_active_minutes_for_month`, `compute_active_leave_minutes_for_period`, `find_conflicting_active_leave`) are exercised in the automated test suite only through their DB-free building blocks (matching this repo's pre-existing testing convention for this module) — the actual SQLAlchemy query construction is not covered by an automated test in this environment.

## PASS / AMBER / FAIL

**AMBER.** Code-level implementation (backend, schema files, frontend, tests, docs) is complete and internally consistent — all automated tests pass, the OpenAPI contract matches the required route/field set exactly, and static analysis confirms zero remaining approval-workflow references anywhere in the changed files. The migration file is authored, reviewed, and idempotent, but has not yet been executed against the live database (by the user's own choice, not a technical blocker), and the live post-deploy API/frontend smoke test (Steps 19–20) has not yet been performed. Upgrade to PASS requires: (1) user confirmation that the migration ran successfully, (2) deployment, (3) a live smoke test of create/get/conflict/delete against the deployed API.
